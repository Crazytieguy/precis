# Post-rewrite issues

Outstanding issues from the architecture rewrite that need addressing
before calibration.

## Must fix (design violations)


## Should fix (quality/performance)

### Remove semantically dishonest `name` field and `name.rs`

`ExtractedItem.name` and `src/parse/name.rs` compute a "name" for
every item kind, but most items don't have a meaningful name (e.g.
impl blocks, imports, module docs). The field is only genuinely used
by Name-level groups for `find_name_prefix`. Everything else that
touches `name` is either working around its existence or using it
as a proxy for something else (like `mark_reexports` checking
`name.starts_with("self::")`).

Fix: remove `name.rs` and the `name: String` field from
`ExtractedItem`. For logic that genuinely needs a name (Name-level
groups), compute it on demand from the node and source. For logic
using `name` as a proxy (reexport detection, dedup), operate on
the node or source text directly. Don't leave a vestigial "name"
concept encoded where it doesn't belong.
